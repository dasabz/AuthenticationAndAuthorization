Instructions to the candidate for the take home task
Write a simple (and possibly not very secure) authentication and authorization service. The service allows users to be authenticated, and authorizes different behavior. No real knowledge of cryptography is assumed.



Directions

Write in Java
Donâ€™t use any existing security classes from Java (other than hashing/encryption if you need to)
The main entities are:
Users - including special case AnonymousUser
Roles - special entities, that can be associated with individual users or groups. Each group/user can have multiple roles assigned to it
Keep all data in memory, no persistence storage is required
No need to sign tokens in any special way, it is assumed that the communication channel between the API and the consumer is secure
The main points to address are:
Clean API
Performance of all the main operations
Thorough testing (yes, that includes token expiry)
Our deliverable should be a self-contained project we can easily open and run the tests in IntelliJ.  Preferably use Maven
If you use external libraries outside of the standard JDK, please mention in the README and explain their purpose


API to implement
Feel free to name your functions as you see fit, as long as the action is clearly stated.

Create user
    User name
    Password - to be stored in some encrypted form, and don't forget to add salt!
    Should fail if the user already exists

Delete user
    User
    Should fail if the user doesn't exist

Create role
    Role name
    Should fail if the role already exists

Delete role
    Role
    Should fail if the role doesn't exist

Add role to user
    User
    Role
    If the role is already associated with the user, nothing should happen

Authenticate (adjust the parameters to make use of salt as you see fit)
    user name
    password
    return a special "secret" auth token or error, if not found. The token is only valid for pre-configured time (2h)

Authenticate as anonymous:
    returns auth token for anonymous user, if it is allowed in the system, error otherwise

Invalidate auth token
    returns nothing, the token is no longer valid after the call. Handles correctly the case of invalid token given as input

Check role
    auth token
    role
    returns true if role is supported, false otherwise, error if token is invalid

All roles
    auth token
    returns all roles for the user, including based on her groups, error if token is invalid
